**Harnessing AI and Machine Learning for Battery Research: Insights from the Faraday Masterclass 2024**

The Faraday Masterclass 2024 series is providing cutting-edge insights into how advanced computational tools can revolutionize battery research. One of the most anticipated sessions featured Dr. Andy Sotoranka, a distinguished researcher in energy materials, who explored the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in analyzing scattering and spectroscopy data from large-scale research facilities.

Dr. Sotoranka, a Novo Nordic Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at DTU and a Junior Research Fellow at Somerville College, Oxford, has been recognized in Forbes' 30 under 30 for his pioneering contributions to the field. His current research focuses on developing self-driving laboratories for controlled synthesis of inorganic materials, a concept that aligns closely with the integration of AI-driven techniques in materials science.

### **The Role of Experimental Data in Materials Science**

In his presentation, Dr. Sotoranka emphasized that experimental data is the backbone of materials science research. Whether working in a laboratory or validating computational simulations, accurate data analysis is crucial. The primary types of experimental data used in this field include scattering data, spectroscopy, and imaging. The challenge, however, lies in the efficient and accurate interpretation of vast amounts of data generated in large-scale experiments.

At facilities such as synchrotrons and neutron sources, data acquisition happens at high resolutions, often generating thousands of datasets within a short timeframe. Manually analyzing such extensive datasets is impractical, making AI-powered solutions a game-changer.

### **AI and Machine Learning for Scattering and Spectroscopy Data**

Dr. Sotoranka delved into the power of machine learning in analyzing Pair Distribution Function (PDF) data, a method used to understand atomic arrangements in materials. He explained how AI models can automate the traditionally labor-intensive process of structure refinement, which often requires extensive expert knowledge and weeks—or even months—of manual effort.

Traditionally, researchers rely on Rietveld refinement methods to determine atomic structures from scattering data. This process requires a structural model, which is then refined against experimental data. The problem arises when an unknown structure does not match any existing databases, requiring manual hypothesis generation. AI models can now overcome this limitation by identifying structural patterns automatically.

### **Machine Learning Models for Structure Identification**

One of the key innovations presented was the use of supervised machine learning for structure classification. By training AI models on known structures, researchers can quickly classify new experimental datasets, significantly reducing analysis time. However, a major challenge with supervised learning is the need for labeled training data, which may not always be available for novel materials.

To address this, Dr. Sotoranka introduced the concept of unsupervised learning, where AI models identify hidden patterns in data without predefined labels. This approach enables clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to reveal structural relationships that may not be immediately apparent through traditional methods.

### **AI-Powered Structure Prediction Tools**

Several AI-driven tools were introduced in the talk, including:

- **MetalFinder** – An AI model designed to identify metal structures from PDF data.
- **CIF-Finder** – A tool for matching experimental data to known structural models in databases.
- **DeepStruct** – A deep learning-based platform that can predict unknown structures directly from scattering data.

These tools provide researchers with rapid insights, allowing them to test hypotheses in real time and streamline the materials discovery process.

### **Bridging the Gap Between Simulated and Experimental Data**

Despite the progress in AI-driven analysis, Dr. Sotoranka highlighted a fundamental challenge: AI models are often trained on simulated data, whereas experimental data includes noise and artifacts that do not always align perfectly with theoretical predictions. Efforts are ongoing to refine these models so they can adapt to real-world experimental variations.

### **The Future of AI in Battery Research**

As AI and ML continue to evolve, their applications in battery research will expand beyond data analysis. Future developments include self-driving laboratories that autonomously synthesize and test new materials, accelerating innovation in energy storage technologies. With AI's ability to process vast datasets, optimize material compositions, and predict structural properties, we are on the brink of a new era in battery science.

The Faraday Masterclass 2024 series is shedding light on these transformative developments, empowering researchers to harness AI for more efficient and accurate materials research. Dr. Sotoranka’s insights have provided a glimpse into a future where AI-driven discoveries lead to groundbreaking advancements in battery technology, ultimately paving the way for more sustainable energy solutions.
